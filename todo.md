- test addresses and listings
- add Google Map API to get long and lat and timezone
- add credentials to user and do authentication
  - add middleware to graphql endpoints to check for authentication
  - check for authorization
- Full text search?? probably can get city, state, region from Google Maps API
  - research type ahead searches for address/region/city/country/zip code
    - Google offers type ahead searches: https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/autocomplete
      - Pros:
        - Plug and play programming - very fast
      - Cons:
        - Growing more reliant to Google's codebase
        - It is not specific enough / geared towards searches only in the indo region
        - Expensive since after a certain number of requests we need to pay Google, but maybe that's ok since we are going to use them to calculate timezone for long and lat anyway
    - Open source geocoder: https://github.com/pelias/pelias/ https://pelias.io
      - Pros:
        - Free if we maintain it ourselves, but at the cost of spinning up an elasticSearch instance
        - Not relying on Google for everything
        - Configurable to fit our use case
      - Cons:
        - Not plug and play and may need a lot of configuration to fit our needs - over engineering
    - Algolia: https://community.algolia.com/places/examples.html (need compare pricing against Google's)
      - Pros:
        - Plug and play programming; just an alternative to Google
      - Cons:
        - Expensive in the long run just like Google
        - Might be better to keep everything under Google if we are going to use their Maps APIs anyway
